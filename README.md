# Connect-Four Game

## Objective
This project aims to replicate the popular game Connect Four using Python. The game features a terminal-based interface where a player competes against a computer opponent that uses a heuristic-based strategy to enhance its gameplay.

## Description
The Connect-Four Game is developed in Python and runs directly in the terminal. Here are some key features of the game:

### Interactive Board Display: The game board is displayed in the terminal, where players can see the game progress after each move.
### Player vs. Computer Gameplay: Players take turns with the computer to drop their chips into one of the seven columns.
### Enhanced Computer Strategy:
1. Winning Move: The computer will automatically take any available winning moves to secure a victory.
2. Block Opponent's Win: If a player is close to winning, the computer will attempt to block their winning moves.
3. Center Preference: The computer prefers to place chips in the center columns, maximizing potential connections.

## Technologies Used
